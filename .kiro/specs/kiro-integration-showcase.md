- **React Patterns** - File-matched React development patterns
- **Node.js Patterns** - File-matched server-side development patterns  
- **Deployment Best Practices** - Manual context for deployment scenarios

## Kiro Integration Benefits Demonstrated

### Development Velocity
- **Automated Documentation**: Specs and hooks maintain up-to-date documentation
- **Code Quality Assurance**: Continuous quality checks prevent technical debt
- **Context-Aware Guidance**: Steering rules provide relevant best practices
- **Intelligent Tooling**: MCP servers enhance development capabilities

### Knowledge Management
- **Centralized Documentation**: All project knowledge in searchable specs
- **Best Practice Enforcement**: Steering rules ensure consistent code quality
- **Automated Maintenance**: Hooks keep documentation synchronized with code
- **Cross-Reference System**: File references create navigable knowledge graph

### Workflow Optimization
- **Intelligent Automation**: Hooks trigger appropriate actions based on context
- **Multi-Tool Integration**: MCP servers provide unified access to external tools
- **Adaptive Guidance**: Steering rules adjust based on file types and contexts
- **Continuous Improvement**: System learns and adapts to project needs

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Spec-Driven Development
```markdown
# Example: Feature Planning Spec
## Requirements
- #[[file:client/src/components/GameLobby.js]] - Current lobby implementation
- #[[file:server/index.js]] - Socket.io integration points

## Implementation Strategy
1. Analyze existing patterns in referenced files
2. Apply steering rules for React and Node.js patterns
3. Use hooks for automatic documentation updates
4. Leverage MCP servers for external integrations
```

### Hook Orchestration
- **File Save Triggers**: Automatic quality checks and documentation updates
- **Manual Triggers**: Comprehensive analysis and deployment preparation
- **Context-Sensitive Actions**: Different behaviors based on file types and content
- **Cascading Effects**: One hook can trigger others for comprehensive coverage

### MCP Server Synergy
```javascript
// Example: Using multiple MCP servers together
// 1. Filesystem MCP: Read current implementation
// 2. Git MCP: Analyze change history  
// 3. GitHub MCP: Check related issues
// 4. Web Search MCP: Research best practices
// 5. Docker MCP: Verify deployment environment
```

### Steering Rule Hierarchy
1. **Always Active**: Performance optimization, security guidelines
2. **File-Matched**: React patterns for client files, Node.js patterns for server
3. **Manual Context**: Deployment practices when explicitly referenced
4. **Dynamic Loading**: Rules loaded based on current development context

## Measurable Improvements

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Consistency**: Steering rules ensure uniform code patterns
- **Security**: Automated security scanning prevents vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Continuous optimization guidance improves efficiency
- **Maintainability**: Comprehensive documentation reduces onboarding time

### Development Efficiency
- **Reduced Context Switching**: All tools accessible through unified interface
- **Automated Maintenance**: Hooks handle routine documentation tasks
- **Intelligent Suggestions**: Context-aware recommendations accelerate development
- **Knowledge Retention**: Specs preserve architectural decisions and rationale

### Project Scalability
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns documented in specs
- **Extensible Patterns**: Steering rules guide consistent expansion
- **Tool Integration**: MCP servers provide foundation for additional capabilities
- **Process Automation**: Hooks scale development processes automatically

## Future Kiro Enhancements
