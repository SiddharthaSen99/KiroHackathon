# Game Balance and Design Guidelines

## Scoring System Principles
- Reward creativity while maintaining fairness
- Exact matches should give maximum points (100)
- Partial matches should provide meaningful rewards (20-80 points)
- Consider both string similarity and semantic meaning
- Prevent gaming the system with overly simple prompts

## Timing and Pacing
- Round duration should allow thoughtful guessing without dragging (60s default)
- Provide clear visual feedback for time remaining
- Allow brief result review between rounds (5s)
- Keep total game length reasonable (5 rounds default)

## Prompt Guidelines
- Word limits prevent overly complex or simple prompts (5 words max)
- Encourage descriptive but concise language
- Provide helpful tips to guide prompt creation
- Consider implementing prompt categories or themes for variety

## User Experience
- Clear visual hierarchy and game state communication
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Graceful handling of network issues and disconnections
- Intuitive controls that don't require explanation

## Accessibility
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Provide text alternatives for visual elements
- Support keyboard navigation where appropriate
- Consider screen reader compatibility
