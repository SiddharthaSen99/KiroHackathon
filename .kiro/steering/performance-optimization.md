# Performance Optimization Guidelines

## React Performance Best Practices

### Component Optimization
- Use React.memo for expensive components that receive stable props
- Implement proper dependency arrays in useEffect and useMemo hooks
- Avoid creating objects/functions in render methods
- Use useCallback for event handlers passed to child components

### State Management
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- Use local state instead of global state when appropriate
- Batch state updates when possible
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by splitting state logically

### Socket.io Performance
- Clean up event listeners in useEffect cleanup functions
- Throttle or debounce frequent socket events
- Use proper event namespacing to avoid conflicts
- Implement connection pooling for multiple rooms

## Server-Side Performance

### AI API Optimization
- Implement intelligent caching for generated images
- Use connection pooling for HTTP requests
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Monitor and optimize API response times

### Memory Management
- Clean up timers and intervals properly
- Remove disconnected players from memory
- Implement garbage collection for old game rooms
- Monitor memory usage patterns

### Database Optimization (Future)
- Use proper indexing strategies
- Implement connection pooling
- Use prepared statements for security and performance
- Consider read replicas for scaling

## Bundle Size Optimization

### Code Splitting
- Implement route-based code splitting
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Split vendor bundles appropriately
- Analyze bundle composition regularly

### Asset Optimization
- Compress images and use appropriate formats
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Use CDN for static assets
- Minimize CSS and JavaScript bundles

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Performance Monitoring
- Track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Monitor API response times
- Track error rates and types
- Measure user engagement metrics

### Cost Optimization
- Monitor AI API usage and costs
- Implement usage quotas and limits
- Track cost per user/session
- Optimize provider selection based on cost/quality

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing performance optimizations:

1. **Measure First** - Always profile before optimizing
2. **Focus on Impact** - Prioritize optimizations with highest user impact
3. **Test Thoroughly** - Ensure optimizations don't break functionality
4. **Monitor Continuously** - Track performance metrics over time
5. **Document Changes** - Keep record of optimization decisions and results
