   - Type: `CNAME`, Name: `@`, Content: `your-app-name.railway.app` (or render URL)
   - Type: `CNAME`, Name: `www`, Content: `your-app-name.railway.app`

### If using other DNS providers:
1. Add A record pointing to the IP provided by your hosting service
2. Add CNAME record for www subdomain

## Testing Your Deployment

1. Visit `https://imprompt.to`
2. Create a room and test with multiple browser tabs
3. Share the room code with friends to test multiplayer

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **CORS errors**: Check that your domain is in the CORS configuration
2. **Socket.io connection fails**: Ensure WebSocket support is enabled
3. **Environment variables**: Double-check all API keys are set correctly
4. **Build fails**: Check that all dependencies are in package.json

### Monitoring:
- Check your hosting platform's logs for errors
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Set up alerts for downtime

## Cost Optimization

- Together.ai: ~$0.008 per image (recommended)
- Monitor usage in your hosting dashboard
- Consider implementing rate limiting for heavy usage
